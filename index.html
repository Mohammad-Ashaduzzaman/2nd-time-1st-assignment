                Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, 
                it can be deeply rewarding for you too. 
                Millions of people give to charity on a 
                regular basis to support causes they 
                believe in, as well as for the positive 
                effect it has on their own lives.

                Shelter is one of the basic needs of human existence.

                nature, from threats, natural or 
                otherwise. A house provides a sense 
                of security and wellbeing, along with 
                an economic standing in society.

                Giving to charities – whether 
                monetary or donated goods is a 
                mood booster. Helping those in need 
                can make you feel more content and 
                fulfilled. Research has shown that 
                there is a link between making a 
                donation to charity and feeling joy.

                There has been an accelerated growth

                 developing countries during the recent

                 realisation in these countries that voluntary
